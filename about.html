                        Hello! My name is Julia Xie.
                        <br>
                        I am a high school student at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute in North York, Ontario, Canada, and I am currently taking the ICS4U0 course.
                        I am also in the MaCS (Math and Computer Science) program at my school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my classes, I code mainly in Java, and my skills are demonstrated by the projects and tutorials I have written on this website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also enjoy competitive programming, and have won many of the competitions held in my school with my teammates.
                        You can check out my solutions to problems in my WLMOJ, DMOJ and GitHub accounts in the contact page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from computer programming, I also enjoy playing sports, including badminton, soccer, and skiing/snowboarding.
                        I also enjoy playing different instruments including the piano and guitar.
                    </p>
