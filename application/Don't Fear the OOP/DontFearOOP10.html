"That's her book?" you ask yourself. "Ten pages of slogging through ugly yellow text for this?" <p>
So what is so special about this plot? Well, it's not everything that's happening in the main routine, but rather everything that happens behind the scenes. When Eunice created that castle called Calcifer, she created (instantiated) an object of type castle. This object had all the characteristics of a standard castle (do you remember the binders?) The same thing goes for the Maurice object and the (pardon me for this) Mary object. While some of the traits of these objects were specified at the time of creation, most of their traits were specified back in the binders, or classes. This allowed Eunice to say a good deal while only saying a little bit in her main routine. <p>
So Eunice's main plot (routine) turns out to be nothing more than a collection of references to objects, which in turn are references to classes. It is, to mix metaphors again, literary federalism, with everything being dealt with at the lowest level possible. <p>
So what are the benefits of this? Well, imagine that instead of one page, Eunice's editor wanted a book of five hundred pages. Or let's say that Eunice decided that Maurice the king shouldn't be so confident. Instead of going back and laboriously changing all her instances of Maurice making announcements to the castle and marching through parades (or whatever it is that confident folks do), Eunice could just make some changes to the Maurice object at the time of instantiation. Or she could change the King class to be less confident. Or she could even create a *new* class, called UnconfidentKing. She's got a lot of options; the point is that she only needs to make the changes in one place.<p> 
But that's not Eunice's only reason for writing her books in Java. She has a keen idea for the future of fairy tales. She sees interactivity. And if, instead of being bound in pages, her characters live in objects and classes, Eunice is free to create a Virtual Calcifer. Readers (on her website) could be prompted for their own actions and her characters could respond in a variety of ways, according to what was written in their classes. Using Java, Eunice could finally bring the fairy tale to life. And hey, I'm sure she's not the only one yearning for the days of kings, queens, and jousting.
