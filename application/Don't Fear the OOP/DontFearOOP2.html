So now we've sneaked a peak at one of Eunice's binders. She has reviewed the castle section and thinks that this fairy tale should take place in, not surprisingly, a castle. So she's ready to write the first part of her plot. Eunice turns to the main paper that is sitting in the middle of her desk and starts to write the story. 
<font color = 009900><b><p>
The Feast in the Banquet Hall<br>
This story takes place in a castle called Calcifer. Calcifer has two gates, 23 animals, and 42 inhabitants. 
</b><p>
Just a couple lines, but Eunice has, in fact, said quite a bit. When she sends the story to her editor, he will look up "castle" in the binders she sends along and fill in the time, location, and number of walls. In addition, Eunice has added information about the gates, animals and inhabitants. But that's okay, because her editor was expecting it. Because her binder stated that every castle would have a certain number of these, but didn't say how many, her editor was quite happy to see them specified in her plot. Even though her main plot page only has two lines, because of the reference to her binder, her story already contains quite a bit of information. <font color = 555500><b><p>
Main Feast<br>
&nbsp Castle calcifer is a new Castle. <br>
&nbsp the number of gates in calcifer is two. <br>
&nbsp the number of animals is 23. <br>
&nbsp the number of inhabitants is 42. <p>
</b>
Eunice takes two very important steps early on in her plot. First, she instantiates an object of type Castle. Having created her first object, Eunice then goes on to fill out the information that was initially lacking in the Castle class: (number of gates, animals, inhabitants) 
<font color = AA0000><b><p>
public class Feast  <br>
&nbsp {  <br>
&nbsp public static void main (String arguments[])  <br>
&nbsp {  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp Castle calcifer = new Castle;  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp calcifer.gates = 2;  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp calcifer.animals = 23;  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp calcifer.inhabitants = 42;  <br>
&nbsp }  <br>
} <p>
</b>
Eunice sure has a strange way of saying things, doesn't she? It would be possible to explain what each word in those first two lines does, but it wouldn't make much sense to you at this point, and it would really tax my small brain, so let's skip it for now, eh? What's important to know is that that line is how Eunice let's her editor know that this piece of paper is her main routine, or plot. 
When she decides to specify those variables (gates, etc) that were not specified in the Castle class, Eunice first states the name of the object (in this case, calcifer). Remember that calcifer is an object of Castle) followed by a period and then by the name of the variable. Having done this, Eunice can then provide a value for the variable, such as two.
