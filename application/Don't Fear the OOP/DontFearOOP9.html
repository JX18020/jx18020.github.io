All this work with new soldiers and kings is making Eunice feel a bit run down, so she decides to stop working on her characters for a little while, and to work a bit on the main plot. 
Accordingly, she sets her pen to the sheet of paper labeled main routine. 

<font color = 00AA00><b><p>
Here is the main plot of the Feast in the Banquet Hall: There is a castle called Calcifer. Calcifer has two gates, 23 animals, and 42 inhabitants. There is a male king named Maurice. Maurice has a gold crown, a red robe, and a horse named "Baron Humbert von Gikkingen". Maurice prefers formal clothing. Mary is a female human. She has a horse named "Yakul" and she prefers loose-fitting clothing. In our story, Maurice starts out by making a trade deal. He then lets everyone know how wealthy he is, and then recruits a woman named Mary.
