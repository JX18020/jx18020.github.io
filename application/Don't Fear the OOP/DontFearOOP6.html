Now, the kings in Eunice's stories are famous for being extremely rich. Hence, it's very difficult for an onlooker to gauge how wealthy one of her kings really is. Eunice decides that it's a good idea to allow her king to state how wealthy he is, so, she writes a new method: <font color = 009900><b><p>
If someone asks a king how wealthy he is, the king will always respond with his level of wealth. 
</b><p>
<font color = 555500><b><p>
howWealthyAmI <br> &nbsp
tell them how wealthy I am 

<font color = AA0000><p>
public int howWealthyAmI () <br>
{ <br> &nbsp
return wealth; <br>
}  <p>
</b>
If you're wondering about that "int" in front of the "howWealthyAmI()", Eunice had to put that in because this method has a return value. In order to let the editor know what sort of value was being returned, she specified "int" (for integer) in front of the name of the method. Remember, her editor doesn't like surprises, and if she didn't tell him what sort of variable this method was going to return, he'd get all hot and flustered. (Now, we don't want that, do we?)
