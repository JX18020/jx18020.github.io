So now we've sneaked a peak at one of Eunice's binders. She has reviewed the castle section and thinks that this fairy tale should take place in, not surprisingly, a castle. So she's ready to write the first part of her plot. Eunice turns to the main paper that is sitting in the middle of her desk and starts to write the story. 
<font color = 009900><b><p>
Whenever the main plot says that a trade deal was successful, his level of wealth will go up by one. 
</b><p>
While this may not look any different than any of the things that we were doing before, you should note that Eunice is specifying how one of her characters acts, rather than just how he/she/it looks. You should also note that she is altering one of her variables here, the variable "wealth". Since her binders (classes) can contain information about how her characters act, Eunice can create quite a bit of character development without ever even touching her main plot page. <font color = 555500><b><p>
tradeSucessfully<br> &nbsp
wealth increases by one <p>
</b>
Eunice takes two very important steps early on in her plot. First, she instantiates an object of type Castle. Having created her first object, Eunice then goes on to fill out the information that was initially lacking in the Castle class: (number of gates, animals, inhabitants) 
<font color = AA0000><b><p>
public void tradeSuccessfully () <br>
{ <br>&nbsp 
wealth++; <br>
} <p>
</b>
Although Eunice used quite a bit of strange symbols, her approach was straightforward and consistent. The first thing that she did was to name the method "tradeSucessfully". Since the method name is tradeSucessfully, Eunice figures that she should modify the king's level of wealth, in this case by adding one to it. That is what the "++" after "wealth" does.
