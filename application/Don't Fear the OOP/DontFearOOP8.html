At this point, it might be a good idea to review what Eunice's overall description of a king looks like. None of this material is new, just a compilation of what we've gone over in the past few pages. <font color = 009900><p><b>
Kings are based on the idea of humans. They are identical, except that they have some additional qualities, namely a crown, a robe, a certain "look", some level of wealth, and a certain quantity of new soldiers in his army. Your standard king will look pompous, start the day out rich, and have 10 soldiers on duty. 
Whenever the main plot says that a trade deal is successful, his level of wealth will go up by one. If someone asks a king how wealthy he is, the king will always respond with his level of wealth. If the king is supposed to recruit a new soldier,  recruit the specified new soldier, then add one to the number of new soldier he has recruited. Then print out "Yay! (the specified new Soldier) has been hired!"

We have introduced here the idea of subclasses. "Humans"; was a class, and "Kings" a subclass of it. 
You may also be wondering why Eunice declared "Humans[] servants" in this class. Think of it this way. If the king is going to hire a servant, Eunice's editor has to know what a servant is. By declaring "Humans[] servants", her editor will know that a servant is a type of human. 
Boy, it all makes sense except that bit about that "public String whatIsYourName()" business, eh? Don't worry. We'll get to all that in just a little bit.
