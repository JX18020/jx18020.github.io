So, believe it or not, you've just seen object-oriented programming in action. Our author Eunice first created a class (that was the binder) that roughly described a castle, then turned to her main plot page and created (instantiated) a castle object, which she then called calcifer. 
Now, for her king, Eunice needs a different binder. So she puts "castles" back on the shelf, and goes to pick up a new binder. Her hand passes over many different titles, like "Animals", "Food", "Weather", "Music", all the essentials for a good fairy tale, until she finally comes to the binder she wants: "Humans". She opens up to the introduction: 
<font color = 009900><b><p>
"All humans start out with two legs, two arms, eyes, a nose, and a mouth. They are either male or female, have a name, have a horse with a name, and have different preferences in clothing. If someone asks, humans can respond with their name." 
</b><p>
You'll notice that Eunice likes to make all body parts variables. This gives her the freedom to change their values later in the story. It is her well-known propensity for gore that has drawn so many readers to Eunice's particular brand of fairy tale. You'll note that she left the sex, name, horse name, and clothing preference unspecified. Just so all of her humans don't look identical, Eunice prefers to specify those variables when she writes the plot. 
<font color = 555500><b><p>
Humans <br>
have a certain number of legs  <br> &nbsp
have a certain number of arms  <br> &nbsp
have a certain number of eyes  <br> &nbsp
have a certain number of noses  <br> &nbsp
have a certain number of mouths  <br> &nbsp
have a name have a certain sex  <br> &nbsp
have a horse with a name  <br> &nbsp
have a strong preference in clothing <p> 

A standard human would start with  <br> &nbsp
two legs <br> &nbsp
two arms  <br> &nbsp
two eyes  <br> &nbsp
one nose  <br> &nbsp
one mouth  <p> 
When someone asks for your name <br> &nbsp
Tell them your name <p>

</b>
You, being as sharp as you are, notice that Eunice's human has some interactivity. She can ask its name, and it will respond. This is called a method and is your key to a good time. We'll get to it in just a few pages. <font color = AA0000><b><p>
public class Humans   <br> 
{   <br> &nbsp
int legs;   <br> &nbsp
int arms;   <br> &nbsp
int eyes;   <br> &nbsp
int nose;   <br> &nbsp
int mouth;   <br> &nbsp
String name;   <br> &nbsp
String sex;   <br> &nbsp
String horseName;   <br> &nbsp
String clothingPreference;   <br> &nbsp

public Humans()  <br> &nbsp 
{   <br> &nbsp &nbsp
legs = 2;    <br> &nbsp &nbsp
arms = 2;    <br> &nbsp &nbsp   
eyes = 2;    <br> &nbsp &nbsp   
nose = 1;    <br> &nbsp &nbsp
mouth = 1;    <br> &nbsp 
} <br> &nbsp 

public String whatIsYourName() <br> &nbsp 
{ <br> &nbsp &nbsp
return name; <br> &nbsp 
} <br> 
} <p>

</b>
Boy, it all makes sense except that bit about that "public String whatIsYourName()" business, eh? Don't worry. We'll get to all that in just a little bit.
