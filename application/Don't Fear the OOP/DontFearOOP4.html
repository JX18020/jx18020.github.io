As interesting as these descriptions of humans may be, however, they're not very specific. Eunice promised her editor a new story by Friday, so she decides to get down to business. Flipping through the "Humans" binder, she comes to the first chapter, entitled "Kings" 
<font color = 009900><p>
Kings are based on the idea of humans. They are identical, except that they have some additional qualities, namely a crown, a robe, a certain "look", some level of wealth, and a certain quantity of servants serving him. Your standard king will look pompous, start the day out rich, and not yet have captured any damsels. 
Nothing really new here, except that we have peered deeper into Eunice's binders (classes) to see one of the subsections (subclasses). This particular subsection, kings, extended the idea of humans. <b><p>

King extends the idea of Humans.   <br> &nbsp
A King   <br> &nbsp
has a crown.   <br> &nbsp
has a robe.   <br> &nbsp
has a "look".   <br> &nbsp
has some level of wealth.   <br> &nbsp
has a certain number of new soldier.  <br>
 
For a given King,   <br> &nbsp
He will look pompous.   <br> &nbsp
He will start out rich.   <br> &nbsp
He will start the day without having any new soldiers.

public class King extends Humans <br>
{ <br> &nbsp
String crownColor; <br> &nbsp
String robeColor;  <br> &nbsp
String look;  <br> &nbsp
int wealth; <br> &nbsp
int numberOfSoldiers;  <br> &nbsp
Humans newSoldier;  <br> &nbsp

public King()  <br> &nbsp
{  <br> &nbsp&nbsp
look = "Pompous";  <br> &nbsp&nbsp
wealth = 500;  <br> &nbsp&nbsp
numberOfServants = 0;  <br> &nbsp&nbsp
}  <br> 
}

We have introduced here the idea of subclasses. "Humans"; was a class, and "Kings" a subclass of it. 
You may also be wondering why Eunice declared "Humans newSoldier" in this class. Think of it this way. If the king is going to recruit new soldier, Eunice's editor has to know what a new soldier is. By declaring "Humans newSoldier", her editor will know that a new soldier is a type of human.
