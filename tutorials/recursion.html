    <h3>Recursion</h3>
    <div class="tutorials">
        <p2>
            <p>
                Recursion is essentially calling a method inside of itself.
                There are 3 main ways to use a recursive method.
                There is regular recursion, tail recursion, and mutual recursion.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Recursion
            </h4>
            <p>
                A recursive method is one in which there is a base case, and a method call to itself.
                A problem can be solved recursively if it can be divided into smaller subsections which can be solved.
                The base case is the smallest subsection in the problem.
                Here is an example of a recursive method:
            </p>
            <pre>
    public int factorial(int n) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
            </pre>
            <p>
                This method returns the factorial of any number.
                It checks whether the number is less than or equal to 1, where it would return 1.
                If it is greater than 1, it returns the number multiplied by the method call again using the number minus 1.
                Here is a tracing of factorial(5):
            </p>
            <pre>
    factorial(5) = 5 * factorial(4) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = returns 120
    factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = returns 24
    factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2) = 3 * 2 * 1 = returns 6
    factorial(2) = 2 * factorial(1) = 2 * 1 = returns 2
    factorial(1) = 1 = returns 1
            </pre>
            <p>
                That means factorial(5) returns 120.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Tail Recursion
            </h4>
            Tail recursion is when the recursive call is the last line in a method.
            <pre>
    public int factorialHelper(int n, int product) {
        if (n <= 1)
            return product;
        return factorialHelper(n - 1, n * product);
    }

    public int factorial(int n) {
        return factorialHelper(n, 1);
    }
            </pre>
            <p>
                This is a tail recursive version of the factorial method.
                As seen in the method, the last line of the method is the recursive call, and no modifications are made to the return statement other than within the parameters.
                However, to make sure the method works every time, there is a method in which the <code>factorialHelper()</code> method is called with the parameters <code>n</code> and 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the tracing of factorial(5) for the tail recursive factorial method:
            </p>
            <pre>
    factorial(5) =  factorialHelper(5, 1)
                    factorialHelper(4, 5)
                    factorialHelper(3, 20)
                    factorialHelper(2, 60)
                    factorialHelper(1, 120)
                    return 120;
            </pre>
            <p>
                Thus, factorial(5) is 120.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Mutual Recursion
            </h4>
            <p>
                Mutual recursion is when two or more methods call each other recursively.
                So, say method A calls method B, method B also calls method A.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is an example of mutual recursion:
            </p>
            <pre>
    public int A(int a) {
        if (a <= 1)
            return a;
        return (B(a - 2));
    }

    public int B(int b) {
        return b * (A(b));
    }
            </pre>
            <p>
                In this example, method <code>A()</code> calls method <code>B()</code>, and when method <code>B()</code> is called, it calls method <code>A()</code>.
                This occurs until the parameter in method <code>A()</code> is equal to or less than 0.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the tracing of A(5):
            </p>
            <pre>
    A(5)
    =   B(3)
        =   3 * A(3)
                =   3 * B(1)
                        =   3 * 1 * A(1)
                                    =   3 * 1 * 1 = 3
            </pre>
            <p>
                After tracing the method, we can conclude that A(5) returns 3.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Recursion vs Iteration
            </h4>
            <p>
                Many problems can be solved recursively or iteratively.
                For example, binary search can be done both as a recursive method and as an iterative method.
