<h3>Application of Concepts</h3>
<div class="tutorials">
    <p2>
        Knowing how all the concepts work and understanding example code is good and all, but what really matters is being able to apply that knowledge to a program.
        <h4>
            Object-Oriented Programming
        </h4>
        <p>
            The best way to understand OOP is to relate it to real world scenarios or situations.
            <l><a href="../application/Don't%20Fear%20the%20OOP/DontFearOOP.html" target="_blank">This assignment</a></l>, called Don't Fear the OOP, was my first introduction to object-oriented programming.
            In the assignment, I explain the concept of OOP in terms of a fairy tale.
            Many aspects of a fairy tale can be translated into object-oriented programming.
            Certain people, animals, or settings can be thought of as objects, and they can have behaviours and attributes, which are the most important parts of OOP.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Arrays & ArrayLists
        </h4>
        <p>
            An easy way to understand arrays is to visualize them as a deck of cards.
            The next assignment uses two classes, a <l><a href="../application/Card.html" target="_blank">Card class</a></l>, and a <l><a href="../application/Deck_Of_Cards.html" target="_blank">DeckOfCards</a></l> class.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Sort/Search
        </h4>
        <p>
            <l><a href="../application/CountingCards.html" target="_blank">The next assignment</a></l> is also a representation of a deck of cards, however it sorts and searches for cards according to the rules of Bridge.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Recursion
        </h4>
        <p>
            This next example is a part of an assignment.
            The goal of this assignment was to use recursion to solve problems, including a problem about a <l><a href="../application/maze.html" target="_blank">maze</a></l>.
            I had to figure out how to search each path in the maze to figure out if there was a possible path to the exit of the maze.
