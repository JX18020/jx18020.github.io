            Arrays and array lists are a way to store many values of the same data type.
            For example, it can store 1000 emails for a newspaper website, 30 student marks for a class, or 10 different models of cars.
            Each value in an array is called an element, and each position of each element is called an index.

                One-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A one-dimensional array is an array which is linear.
            It only requires one index to specify any element of the array.
            <p></p>
            <b>Initializing a One-Dimensional Array</b>
            <p></p>
            There are two main ways to initialize an array.
            The first way is to declare the array and initialize each element at the same time.
            The length of the array is also set at the same time when it initialized this way.
            For example, the following array would have a length of 8.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = {1, 6, 3, 6, 0, 3, 2, 7};
            </pre>
            Another way is to declare the array while also declaring the length of the array.
            Since an array is an object, the keyword <i>new</i> must be used to declare the array.
            The following array would have a length of 56.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = new int [56];
            </pre>
            The square brackets (<code>[]</code>) can be before or after the array name.
            If it is after the array name, it is called <i>C-Style</i>, named after the programming language <i>C</i>.
            Although it is allowed, c-style is often discouraged and considered bad programming style in Java.
            Putting the square brackets after the data type is preferred.
            <p></p>
            <h6>
                Two-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A two-dimensional array is a way to store many values, like in a one-dimensional array, but it can be stored as a matrix.
            In other words, the values are stored like a table or coordinate grid.
            Essentially, a two dimensional array is like an array inside of an array.
            The two dimensions of the array are represented by a row and a column and each value is stored under each cell.
            <p></p>
            <b>Initializing a Two-Dimensional Array</b>
            <p></p>
            A two-dimensional array is initialized in a very similar way to one-dimensional arrays.
            Like one-dimensional arrays, a two dimensional array can be created in two ways.
            It can be created by directly initializing the values in the array.
            The following array would have 3 rows and 4 columns.
            <pre>
    int [][] arr = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {4, 3, 2, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 1}};
            </pre>
            The second way is to declare the length of both the row and column.
            Again, since an array is an object, the <i>new</i> keyword must be used.
            The following array would have 8 rows and 14 columns.
            <pre>
    int [][] arr = new int [8][14];
            </pre>
            <h6>
                Multi-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A multi-dimensional array is just an array which has more than two dimensions.
            The initialization process of a multi-dimensional array is the same as with one or two dimensions, just with as many square brackets as there are dimensions.
            <h6>
                Length of Arrays
            </h6>
            In Java, the length of an array is stored in a final variable, compared to the method for the String class.
            That means, to access the length of an array, one needs to use .length.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = new int [10];
    System.out.println(arr.length);
            </pre>
            Output:
            <pre>
    10
            </pre>
            However, since it is stored in a final variable (a constant), the length of an array cannot be changed once it is initialized.
            The only way to change the length of an array is to create temporary array, transfer the contents of the original array into the temporary array, create an new array with the wanted size, and transfer the contents back into the original array.
            <p></p>
            <b>Length of Two-Dimensional Arrays</b>
            <p></p>
            To access the number of rows in a two-dimensional array, one can use .length like as one would for a one-dimensional array.
            However, to access the number of columns in a two-dimensional array, you have to specify the row first.
            Here is an example of that.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = new int [8][3];
    System.out.println(arr.length);     // the number of rows in the array
    System.out.println(arr[0].length);  // the number of columns in the array
            </pre>
            Output:
            <pre>
    8
    3
            </pre>
            Something which is allowed in Java which is not allowed in many programming languages are ragged arrays.
            A ragged array is a two-dimensional array in which the number of columns in not consistent with each row.
            <pre>
    int [][] arr = {{1, 2, 3}, {3, 2}, {4, 5, 6, 7}};
    System.out.println (arr.length);    // the number of rows in the array
    System.out.println (arr[0].length); // the number of columns in the first row
    System.out.println (arr[1].length); // the number of columns in the second row
    System.out.println (arr[2].length); // the number of columns in the third row
            </pre>
            Output:
            <pre>
    3
    3
    2
    4
            </pre>
            The number of rows in the above array is 3.
            The number of columns in the array are different, with the first having 3 columns, the second having 2, and the third having 4.

            <h6>
                Traversing an Array
            </h6>
            The indices of an array of length N would range from 0 to N-1.
            So, if one were to try to access the element at index 5 in an array which has a length of 5, it would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
            To access one specific element of an array, one can use use square brackets, while specifying the index of the element.
            <pre>
        int [] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            </pre>
            For example, to access the 3rd element of the above array one would need to use <code>arr[2]</code>.
            To access every element of the array, the easiest way is to use a for loop, which could loop through the indices of the array.
            Here is an example of that:
            <pre>
        int [] arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};

        for (int i = 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++) {
            System.out.println (arr[i]);
        }
            </pre>
            Output:
            <pre>
        5
        4
        3
        2
        1
            </pre>
        </p2>
