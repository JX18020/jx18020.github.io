            Arrays and array lists are a way to store many values of the same data type.
            For example, it can store 1000 emails for a newspaper website, 30 student marks for a class, or 10 different models of cars.
            Each value in an array is called an element, and each position of each element is called an index.

                One-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A one-dimensional array is an array which is linear.
            It only requires one index to specify any element of the array.

            <b>Initializing a One-Dimensional Array</b>
            <p></p>
            There are two main ways to initialize an array.
            The first way is to declare the array and initialize each element at the same time.
            The length of the array is also set at the same time when it initialized this way.
            For example, the following array would have a length of 8.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = {1, 6, 3, 6, 0, 3, 2, 7};
            </pre>
            Another way is to declare the array while also declaring the size of the array.
            Since an array is an object, the keyword <i>new</i> must be used to declare the array.
            The following array would have a size of 56.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = new int [56];
            </pre>
            The square brackets ([]) can be before or after the array name.
            If it after the array name, it is called <i>C-Style</i>, named after the programming language <i>C</i>.
            Although it is allowed, c-style is often discouraged and considered bad programming style in java and putting the square brackets after the data type is preferred.
