            Arrays and array lists are a way to store many values of the same data type.
            For example, it can store 1000 emails for a newspaper website, 30 student marks for a class, or 10 different models of cars.
            Each value in an array is called an element, and each position of each element is called an index.

                One-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A one-dimensional array is an array which is linear.
            It only requires one index to specify any element of the array.
            <p></p>
            <b>Initializing a One-Dimensional Array</b>
            <p></p>
            There are two main ways to initialize an array.
            The first way is to declare the array and initialize each element at the same time.
            The length of the array is also set at the same time when it initialized this way.
            For example, the following array would have a length of 8.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = {1, 6, 3, 6, 0, 3, 2, 7};
            </pre>
            Another way is to declare the array while also declaring the length of the array.
            Since an array is an object, the keyword <i>new</i> must be used to declare the array.
            The following array would have a length of 56.
            <pre>
    int [] arr = new int [56];
            </pre>
            The square brackets (<code>[]</code>) can be before or after the array name.
            If it is after the array name, it is called <i>C-Style</i>, named after the programming language <i>C</i>.
            Although it is allowed, c-style is often discouraged and considered bad programming style in Java.
            Putting the square brackets after the data type is preferred.
            <p></p>
            <h6>
                Two-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A two-dimensional array is a way to store many values, like in a one-dimensional array, but it can be stored as a matrix.
            In other words, the values are stored like a table or coordinate grid.
            Essentially, a two dimensional array is like an array inside of an array.
            The two dimensions of the array are represented by a row and a column and each value is stored under each cell.
            <p></p>
            <b>Initializing a Two-Dimensional Array</b>
            <p></p>
            A two-dimensional array is initialized in a very similar way to one-dimensional arrays.
            Like one-dimensional arrays, a two dimensional array can be created in two ways.
            It can be created by directly initializing the values in the array.
            The following array would have 3 rows and 4 columns.
            <pre>
    int [][] arr = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {4, 3, 2, 1}, {2, 3, 4, 1}};
            </pre>
            The second way is to declare the length of both the row and column.
            Again, since an array is an object, the <i>new</i> keyword must be used.
            The following array would have 8 rows and 14 columns.
            <pre>
    int [][] arr = new int [8][14];
            </pre>
            <h6>
                Multi-Dimensional Arrays
            </h6>
            A multi-dimensional array is just an array which has more than two dimensions.
            The initialization process of a multi-dimensional array is the same as with one or two dimensions, just with as many square brackets as there are dimensions.
