    <h3>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
        <div id = tutorials>
            <p2>
                OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Many programming languages are object-oriented, including Java.
                <h6>
                    What Is Object-Oriented Programming?
                </h6>
                Object-oriented programming refers the programming paradigm which involves the creation of objects.
                This is meant to reflect the real world, with each object having attributes and behaviours.
                OOP hinges on a number of basic concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                <h6>
                    Advantages and Disadvantages of Object-Oriented Programming
                </h6>
                Object-oriented programming isn't the only form of programming out there.
                The two other main programming paradigms are Functional Programming (FP) and Procedural Programming (PP).
                <p></p>
                Functional programming passes data through functions and computes data using mathematical functions.
                Procedural programming works in a series of steps, and is based on the concept of the procedure call.
                Both paradigms are useful in their own ways, as with object-oriented programming.
                <p></p>
                The fact that object-oriented programming treats everything as objects, the objects can be reused in the different application and projects.
                Furthermore, OOP uses a modular structure, which means that everything is easily maintainable without making big changes to the program.
                Also, data is able to be hidden, so it is very secure.
                <h6>
                    Objects
                </h6>
                Objects are the very fundamental aspects of object-oriented programming.
                They are made to reflect the real world, and can be reused in different applications.
                Each object has as least one attribute and behaviour.
                <p></p>
                For example, a car is an object.
                Each car has a certain number of wheels, certain number of doors, a colour, a model, etc.
                They also have behaviours such as driving, parking, and braking.
                In programming, an attribute or state translates into a <i>field</i> or <i>variables</i>, which can be manipulated.
                A behaviour can be translated into a method (also known as a function or procedure), and these can be used to manipulate the attributes.
                <h6>
                    Classes
                </h6>
                Classes in object-oriented programming are essentially a template for an object.
                Each class serves as a blueprint, and an copy of the class, or an <i>instance</i> of the class, can create any number of said objects.
