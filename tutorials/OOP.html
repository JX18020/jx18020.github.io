    <h3>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
    <div id = tutorials>
        <p2>
            OOP stands for <i>Object-Oriented Programming</i>. Many programming languages are object-oriented, including Java.
            <h6>
                What Is Object-Oriented Programming?
            </h6>
            Object-oriented programming refers the programming paradigm which involves the creation of <i>objects</i>.
            This is meant to reflect the real world, with each object having attributes and behaviours.
            OOP hinges on a number of basic concepts, including <i>encapsulation</i>, <i>inheritance</i>, and <i>polymorphism</i>.
            <h6>
                Advantages and Disadvantages of Object-Oriented Programming
            </h6>
            Object-oriented programming isn't the only form of programming out there.
            The two other main programming paradigms are <i>Functional Programming (FP)</i> and <i>Procedural Programming (PP)</i>.
            <p></p>
            Functional programming passes data through functions and computes data using mathematical functions.
            Procedural programming works in a series of steps, and is based on the concept of the procedure call.
            Both paradigms are useful in their own ways, as with object-oriented programming.
            <p></p>
            The fact that object-oriented programming treats everything as objects, the objects can be reused in the different application and projects.
            Furthermore, OOP uses a modular structure, which means that everything is easily maintainable without making big changes to the program.
            Also, data is able to be hidden, so it is very secure.
            <h6>
                Objects
            </h6>
            Objects are the very fundamental aspects of object-oriented programming.
            They are made to reflect the real world, and can be reused in different applications.
            Each object has as least one <i>attribute</i> and <i>behaviour</i>.
            <p></p>
            For example, a car is an object.
            Each car has a certain number of wheels, certain number of doors, a colour, a model, etc.
            They also have behaviours such as driving, parking, and braking.
            In programming, an attribute or state translates into a <i>field</i> or <i>variables</i>, which can be manipulated.
            A behaviour can be translated into a <i>method</i> (also known as a function or procedure), and these can be used to manipulate the attributes.
            <h6>
                Classes
            </h6>
            Classes in object-oriented programming are essentially a template for an object.
            Each class serves as a blueprint, and an copy of the class, or an <i>instance</i> of the class, can create any number of said objects.
            A constructor is also able to create an object with specific details from the user, or as a default object.
            For example, here is an implementation of a car:
            <p></p>
            <div id="tutorials-code">
                <c1>
                    public class Car { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private String brand; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private String model; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private int kilometers; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private double gas; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private double tankCapacity; <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Car(String b, String m, double g, double tCap) { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brand = b; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model = m; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres = 0; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gas = g; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tankCapacity = tCap; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void drive(double distance) { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kilometres += distance; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gas -= distance / 5; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void gasUp() { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gas = tankCapacity; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
                    }
                </c1>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            The car has the attributes of a brand, model, number of kilometers driven, amount of gas in the tank, and the capacity of the tank.
            Its behaviours are to drive and fill it tank up.
            The constructor allows you to create a car with the specifications of its brand, model, amount of gas, and tank capacity, while it sets the number of kilometers to zero (since a new car has not driven anywhere yet).
