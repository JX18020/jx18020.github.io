                OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Many programming languages are object-oriented, including Java.
                <h6>
                    What Is Object-Oriented Programming?
                </h6>
                Object-oriented programming refers the programming paradigm which involves the creation of objects.
                This is meant to reflect the real world, with each object having attributes and behaviours.
                OOP hinges on a number of basic concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
                <h6>
                    Advantages and Disadvantages of Object-Oriented Programming
                </h6>
                Object-oriented programming isn't the only form of programming out there.
                The two other main programming paradigms are Functional Programming (FP) and Procedural Programming (PP).
                <p></p>
                Functional programming passes data through functions and computes data using mathematical functions.
                Procedural programming works in a series of steps, and is based on the concept of the procedure call.
                Both paradigms are useful in their own ways, as with object-oriented programming.
